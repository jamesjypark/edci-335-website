However, this plan will also take much longer than the first one, as company two will have to complete the designing and planning before purchasing any materials or beginning the construction.

What are your exact needs for your house, and what options does each plan provide to meet them? A regular employee would most likely choose option one, as being able to move in ASAP would be a big plus. However, if the employee was an eccentric millionaire living in a very nice hotel, they might be more inclined to choose option 3 since time or money are not a major concern for them."},{type:"paragraph",text:"Software developers have to make decisions like this all the time.
