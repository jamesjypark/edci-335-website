We use a more constructivist approach in our introduction and with our interactive resource. In our introduction, we provide the learner with a theoretical situation and then ask them what they would do in that situation. We don’t provide a solution (as there is none - it is simply a thought exercise) and thus the user is free to use their own experiences and opinions to decide what to do. Similarly, our interactive section requires active participation from the learner- while the learner is free to design whatever program they like, it is our hope that they choose to design it to be similar to a real world program.

We also have ordered our posts going from the lower-level, more difficult languages to the higher-level, easier languages, which we hope will give the learner a deeper appreciation for how much easier programming languages have become.The interactive section of our resource is the strongest part of this, as the user can design their own simple program and see how much more work it would be to do the same thing in MIPS than C or Python.
