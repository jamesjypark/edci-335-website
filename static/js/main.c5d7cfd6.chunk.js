Like the analogy of house building kits, Python provides many pre-existing functionalities. Thus, programmers work much quicker in Python than in most other languages.

It needs to dynamically figure out what size each variable is, what type each variable is, whether two variables can be added together, as well as a lot of other things going on under the hood.

Since the information is being sent over the internet, using slower, easier languages makes sense since they can be quite slow but still be negligible compared to transmitting data over the internet. Django is one of the top server application libraries, with 60.5K starts (the equivalents of likes) on GitHub. Python is also quite often used in data science since it\u2019s easy for non-programmers or amateur programmers to work with and speed is less important since each query is often only run a couple of times to generate graphs filled with the collected data.
