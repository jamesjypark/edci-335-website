      text: "Since our posts are ordered in increasing difficulty, our learners can see how writing a simple program in C would be much easier and more convenient than in MIPS, without necessarily having to know how to program in either language. Thus, the learner can make connections between the different sections of the resource even without any understanding of any of the languages. We use a more constructivist approach in our introduction and with our interactive resource. In our introduction, we provide the learner with a theoretical situation and then ask them what they would do in that situation. We don’t provide a solution (as there is none - it is simply a thought exercise) and thus the user is free to use their own experiences and opinions to decide what to do. Similarly, our interactive section requires active participation from the learner- while the learner is free to design whatever program they like, it is our hope that they choose to design it to be similar to a real world program. Thus, they get an understanding of how difficult it would be to make this program in MIPS or C and how much easier it would be in Python."

      text: "Our project uses a mainly inquiry-based approach - we provide the learner with an open-ended question (with no definitive answer) and only provide context and knowledge around the question, without actually answering the question itself. Thus, the user is encouraged to draw their own conclusions about how programming languages have changed over time. We also have ordered our posts going from the lower-level, more difficult languages to the higher-level, easier languages, which we hope will give the learner a deeper appreciation for how much easier programming languages have become.The interactive section of our resource is the strongest part of this, as the user can design their own simple program and see how much more work it would be to do the same thing in MIPS than C or Python. The learning is guided by the learner’s own search for answers, and thus it is a fairly inquiry-based resource."

      text: "Our resource was designed to be accessible to anyone in high school or older, without any previous experience in programming. Since our resource is fairly specialized, we didn’t really have an age group in mind when creating it - since programming is not taught in school, a 15 year old and a 30 year old are likely to have the same level of understanding in our topic. One area we did focus on, however, was a learner who is planning to learn how to program but does not know which programming language to start learning with. Our hope is that they could use our learning resource to figure out which programming language they could use for a passion project and use their passion to fuel their further learning in that area. This is also why we state (correctly) that MIPS is not widely used for anything today, as it would be a very poor choice for a beginner’s programming language."

Learners with a loss of hearing will have the exact same experience as learners with hearing, as there is no audio component to the website. Additionally, our website uses high contrast colours to ensure colour blind learners can read the contents without difficulty. Furthermore, we have made our website responsive, which allows it to be used on any shape of device within reason. Thus, someone without access to a computer can access the website on their smartphone or tablet."

One of the first ideas that we had for this resource was an interactive section where the learner could see how the same program looks different in different programming languages. Furthermore, we both had extensive web development experience as well as websites from previous projects that we could reshape into our learning resource, so creating a website wasn’t difficult from a technical perspective.Thus, creating a website was the obvious choice, as it wasn’t significantly more difficult to do, used skills that we both had, allowed us to have a much more interactive section than other formats, and allowed us to build off of a previous project rather than start from scratch."
